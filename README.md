`Find Afaf` is a text based adventure game storytelling our struggle in initiating some paperwork in the governmental offices.
The synopsis of the game is revolving around finding the employee called Afaf; who is holding the keys to the locker that have your unfinished paperwork. Yet the employee cannot be found anywhere.

This project is a self documentation of the learning process of C++. \
The learnt topics till now cover the basics of C++:
- data types.
- data manipulation.
- conditional statements.
- loops.
- and basic function usages.

Hopefully in the not very far feature; this game will have its own version on the playdate game console, or any other, .. who knows :)
